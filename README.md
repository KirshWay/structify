# Structify

**Structify** is a powerful and interactive CLI tool that helps you document, organize, and archive your project's file structure into a single Markdown file. Whether you want to share project code snippets, review your codebase, or back up key files, Structify makes it fast and flexible.

## 🚀 Features

- **Full or Partial Collection**: Collect the entire project or interactively select only the files and folders you need.
- **Interactive Multi-Level Selection**: Navigate through directories and decide whether to include entire folders or specific files.
- **Auto-Ignored Resources**: Skips unnecessary files like `node_modules`, `.env`, images, and fonts. Resource-only directories are flagged in the output.
- **Easy-to-Read Markdown Output**: All selected files are merged into a single `.md` file, with clear separators and code blocks for easy navigation.
