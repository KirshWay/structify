### üèÉ Usage

Structify supports two modes of operation: **Interactive Mode** (default) and **Non-Interactive Mode** (using CLI arguments).

#### Interactive Mode (Default)

Simply run:

```bash
pnpm start
```

In this mode, you will be prompted for:

- **Project Directory:** The path to the project (default: current directory).
- **Collection Mode:** Choose between collecting the entire project or a selective, multi-level selection.
- **Output Settings**:
  ‚Ä¢ **Output File Name**: Enter the name of the output file **without an extension** (the extension will be added automatically based on your format selection).
  ‚Ä¢ **Output Directory**: The directory where the generated file will be saved.
  ‚Ä¢ **Output Format**: Select the desired output format from the available options (Markdown (.md) or Plain Text (.txt)).

During the file selection process, you can navigate through directories using the provided options (including a ".. **(Go up)**" option) to move back to the parent directory and select files from other branches.

#### Non-Interactive Mode

For automated or scripted usage, you can disable interactive prompts by using the `--no-interactive` flag along with the required options. For example:

```bash
pnpm start --no-interactive --project /absolute/path/to/project --mode all --output structure --outdir /absolute/path/to/save --format md
```

**Options:**

- `--no-interactive`: Disables interactive prompts.
- `--project <path>`: Specifies the project directory to process.
- `--mode <mode>`: Sets the collection mode. Use `all` to collect the entire project. _(Note: Non-interactive mode does not support partial selection.)_
- `--output <filename>`: The output file name **without an extension** (the tool will automatically append the appropriate extension based on the chosen format).
- `--outdir <directory>`: The directory where the output file will be saved.
- `--format <format>`: The output file format, either md (Markdown) or txt (Plain Text).

To view the full list of available CLI options, run:

```bash
pnpm start -- --help
```
